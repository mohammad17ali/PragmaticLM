# PragmaticLM: Bridging User Intent with Intelligent Prompt Refinement

PragmaticLM is an advanced language model designed to extract hidden user intent and transform raw prompts into structured, contextually enriched queries. By leveraging cutting-edge transformer architecture and pragmatic reasoning, PragmaticLM refines ambiguous inputs to optimize the performance of downstream large language models (LLMs) such as Llama.

## Introduction

In today's era of AI-driven interactions, understanding the subtle nuances in user prompts is crucial. PragmaticLM bridges this gap by:

- Extracting latent user intent.
- Refining and restructuring prompts.
- Enhancing inference quality when interfacing with external LLMs.

This makes PragmaticLM ideal for applications in conversational agents, decision support systems, and creative content generation.

## Features

- **Pragmatic Understanding:** Captures implicit intent and refines ambiguous prompts.
- **Modular Architecture:** Built on a transformer backbone with additional layers/adapters for enhanced reasoning.
- **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Easily fine-tune on custom datasets for tasks like prompt refinement.
- **Seamless Integration:** Outputs structured prompts for downstream models like Llama.
- **Open Source:** Designed to be extensible and community-friendly.
